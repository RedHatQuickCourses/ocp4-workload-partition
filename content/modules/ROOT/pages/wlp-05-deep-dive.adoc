= 5. Deep Dive and Conclusion

This section explores the mechanics of workload partitioning and summarizes the key takeaways.

== Behind the Scenes: How It Works

The isolation is achieved through a combination of configurations at the Kubelet, CRI-O, and Kernel levels, managed by the Performance Addon Operator.

=== Kubelet Configuration

The `PerformanceProfile` creates a `KubeletConfig` object. The key parameter here is `reservedSystemCPUs`.

. You can inspect the `KubeletConfig` with this command:
+
[source,bash]
----
oc get kubeletconfig performance-openshift-node-performance-profile -o yaml
----

The `reservedSystemCPUs: 0-19` directive in the output instructs the Kubelet to reserve cores 0-19 for the operating system and Kubernetes system daemons. The Kubelet's CPU Manager will only consider the remaining cores (20-23) as allocatable for pods.

. Snippet from `KubeletConfig`
+
[source,yaml]
----
...
spec:
  kubeletConfig:
    ...
    cpuManagerPolicy: static
    reservedSystemCPUs: 0-7
    topologyManagerPolicy: restricted
...
----

=== CRI-O Configuration

Additionally, a CRI-O configuration file is created to pin specific system-level workloads to the reserved cores. This ensures that even containers part of the OpenShift infrastructure are constrained to the reserved set.

. On a master node, you can view this configuration file:
+
[source,bash]
----
cat /etc/crio/crio.conf.d/99-workload-pinning.conf
----

The content of the file specifies that any pod with the `target.workload.openshift.io/management` annotation should be placed on the `0-19` cpuset. This is how control plane pods are pinned.

. Content of `99-workload-pinning.conf`
+
[source,ini]
----
[crio.runtime.workloads.management]
activation_annotation = "target.workload.openshift.io/management"
annotation_prefix = "resources.workload.openshift.io"
resources = { "cpushares" = 0, "cpuset" = "0-7" }
----


=== Verifying Core Isolation at the Kernel Level

The final and most fundamental layer of verification is to inspect the kernel's boot parameters.

. Run the command to see the kernel boot parameters:
+
[source,bash]
----
cat /proc/cmdline
----

The output is a single line containing all boot parameters. Below is a snippet highlighting the most relevant ones for workload partitioning.

. Example Kernel Boot Parameters
+
[source,text]
----
BOOT_IMAGE=(hd0,gpt3)/boot/ostree/rhcos-03dc4c69b357bff5c3a6a9a8ea09a3b120e41dc9b3843635e307bb753b518d4e/vmlinuz-5.14.0-427.64.1.el9_4.x86_64 ignition.platform.id=metal ostree=/ostree/boot.0/rhcos/03dc4c69b357bff5c3a6a9a8ea09a3b120e41dc9b3843635e307bb753b518d4e/0 root=UUID=910678ff-f77e-4a7d-8d53-86f2ac47a823 rw rootflags=prjquota boot=UUID=24be4633-f9c4-4ae6-b4cb-843c099c1f0b skew_tick=1 tsc=reliable rcupdate.rcu_normal_after_boot=1 nohz=on rcu_nocbs=8-15 tuned.non_isolcpus=000000ff systemd.cpu_affinity=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7 iommu=pt amd_pstate=guided isolcpus=managed_irq,8-15 systemd.unified_cgroup_hierarchy=1 cgroup_no_v1=all psi=0
----

The output reveals several key parameters that directly enable workload partitioning:

- `isolcpus=managed_irq,8-15`: Instructs the Linux kernel scheduler to isolate cores 20-23.
- `rcu_nocbs=8-15`: Offloads RCU (Read-Copy-Update) callbacks from the isolated cores to reduce kernel "noise".
- `systemd.cpu_affinity=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7`: Pins the `systemd` init process and its children to the reserved CPU set.

== Node Status Comparison

The effect of workload partitioning is clearly visible in the `oc describe node` output, specifically in the `Capacity` and `Allocatable` sections.

=== After Workload Partitioning

First, let's examine the node's status *after* workload partitioning has been applied.

. Run the command to describe the node:
+
[source,bash]
----
oc describe node master-01-demo
----

The output below shows that while the `Capacity` lists all 24 CPUs, the `Allocatable` CPU count is only 4. This starkly illustrates the 20 cores that have been reserved for the system.

. Example Output (After Partitioning)
+
[source,yaml]
----
...
Capacity:
  cpu:                24
  memory:             30797848Ki
  pods:               250
Allocatable:
  cpu:                4
  memory:             29671448Ki
  pods:               250
...
----

=== Before Workload Partitioning

For comparison, let's look at the status of a node *before* workload partitioning.

. Run the command to describe the node:
+
[source,bash]
----
oc describe node master-01-demo
----

Notice in this output that the `Allocatable` CPU is much higher (e.g., 23.5), as only a small fraction is reserved by default for system overhead.

. Example Output (Before Partitioning)
+
[source,yaml]
----
...
Capacity:
  cpu:                24
  memory:             30797840Ki
  pods:               250
Allocatable:
  cpu:                23500m
  memory:             29646864Ki
  pods:               250
...
----

== Conclusion

Workload partitioning is an essential feature for running OpenShift in resource-constrained environments. By creating a hard boundary between system and workload CPUs, it provides performance isolation, ensures control plane stability, and allows for more predictable application behavior.
