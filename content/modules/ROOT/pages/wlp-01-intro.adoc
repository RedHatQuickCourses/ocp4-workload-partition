= 1. Introduction to Workload Partitioning

Workload Partitioning is a powerful feature in OpenShift designed to provide CPU core isolation between critical OpenShift system components and user-deployed workloads. This isolation is particularly beneficial in resource-constrained environments such as Single-Node OpenShift (SNO) or 3-node compact clusters, where system services and user applications run on the same hosts and compete for CPU resources.

By dedicating specific CPU cores to the system and others to workloads, you can achieve more predictable performance and prevent user applications from impacting the stability and responsiveness of the cluster's control plane.

This lab will provide a detailed demonstration of how to configure and verify workload partitioning. We will deploy sample pods and a virtual machine to observe how the CPU isolation is enforced.
